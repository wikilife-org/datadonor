			<p>The term “you” refers to you whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Wikilife Service), you are a “Researcher” (which means that you are health researcher or other interested member of the public accessing and using Wikilife’s anonymized data), or you are a “Data Donor” (which means that you have registered with the Wikilife Service to donate your data to the Wikilife Service). </p> 
				
			<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, PRIOR TO DOWNLOADING AND/OR USING THE WIKILIFE SERVICE, YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WITHOUT MODIFICATION.   BY USING THE WIKILIFE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

			<h3>Description of Wikilife Service</h3>
			<p>Wikilife is a non-profit global collaborative experiment to collect health and lifestyle information and share it in an open and anonymous way.  </p>
			
			<p>The Wikilife Service collects health and lifestyle data from its Data Donors.  A Data Donor can add data on the DataDonors Website regarding their lifestyle, work, exercise, sleep, eating patterns, mood and health, either by manually entering the data or by uploading their data from a device or connecting their account to a third party service. The Wikilife Service relates all of that Data Donor’s information and the information of its other Data Donor’s in a meaningful way.  Data Donors can compare their lifestyle data with that of other Data Donors around the world on the DataDonors Website.  Through the Wikilife Website, Researchers can access an extensive and comprehensive database of real-time health and lifestyle information available anywhere in the world.   The data collected will reveal patterns that will allow Data Donors and Researchers all over the world to elaborate hypotheses and develop unexplored research areas.</p>
			
			<p>Because Wikilife is an open project, we make all aggregated and anonymized data accessible to anyone at any time. Your data is anonymous to everyone (except yourself) and is available for download in multiple formats.  For more information regarding how we share such aggregated and anonymized data (the “Anonymized Data”), please refer to our Wikilife Privacy and Sharing Statement found on <a href="http://datadonors.org/privacy">http://datadonors.org/privacy</a>, the terms of which are incorporated into this Agreement (the “Privacy Statement”).</p>
