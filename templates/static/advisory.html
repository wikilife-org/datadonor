		{% blocktrans%}I joined the Wikilife Team in March 2010. I am a molecular biologist who has been involved in cancer progression-related research for the past 8 years. I have a PhD in Biological Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires. Part of my research was completed in Marseille, France and with two years at the Mass Spectrometry Lab at UCSF, specializing in proteomics as a tool for identifying tumor markers. I've been been on the faculty (as a teaching assistant) of the Biological Chemistry Department at the University of Buenos Aires, since March 2003.

To protect and preserve our health, it is important to know what is good for us. Becoming a Wikilife user will help us understand which habits contribute to our well-being and will help us improve our lifestyle. Wikilife is a brilliant great experiment, with an unlimited number of participants, and unlimited variables. As a researcher and as an individual who seeks healthy living, I HAD to be a part of Wikilife.

		{% blocktrans%}After attending the first public presentation of Wikilife, I knew immediately that I had to be part of this amazing project. It only took one meeting with founder, Daniel Nofal, for me to join the team. I'm a molecular biologist at University of Buenos Aires– UBA (MSc. Biological Sciences – Cum Laude). After working for more than eleven years in the "Molecular and Cellular Therapy Laboratory" at Leloir Foundation (formerly Campomar Foundation), I obtained a Ph.D from UBA University and a post-doctoral position at The WOUND Consortium (which belongs to the 6th Framework Program for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration for the European Union).

Currently as Joint Professor of the Biological Chemistry Department of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires and CONICET Researcher, I am head of a Bioinformatics group. My research interest focus on developing and applying new bioinformatics methods to transform large amounts of biological data, mostly derived from next generation sequencing, into valuable knowledge. In particular, we plan to understand how human genome variability is associated with disease.

I joined Wikilife in 2013, to help integrate Genomic with health and life-style related data. I am very excited by the potential impact the project in both the scientific community and society as a whole.

		I joined Wikilife in October 2010. The project fascinated me from the beginning and I found it impossible to refuse becoming part of a project that can help humanity. I’ve been developing systems for around 10 years at companies such as Sony, IBM, and Gemalto among others. I also provided courses in UML, Java, Junit, Struts, Hibernate. I am very excited to be working on Wikilife.

I'm a lawyer by training, graduated from the Yale Law School, but my love of the tango drew me to Buenos Aires where I began a career change that led me to marketing and online publicity. I have experience working with clients from around the globe in a variety of languages, first at Google, later at Buscapé, and now with a variety of innovative projects, one of which is Wikilife. What I love about marketing and online advertising is similar to what interested me so much about Wikilife - the potential to change human behavior and make more information available to people who need it.

Cardiologist Graduate Degree at the University of Salvador (Buenos Aires - Argentina). Specialist in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. I've always been comfortable with computer systems and technology in general. I kept studying as a hobby since the beginning of my career in medicine and I always had the idea of joining my profession with my hobby in a way that is relevant and helpful to the community.

Wikilife is a great idea, a team that responds to the specific need to understand more and improve health in the 21st century. With problems that require urgent current healthcare solutions, I can't think of other options that leverage big ideas, solidarity, and global deployment together. I've been involved in several projects focused on guiding, motivating and accompanying people to an active and healthy life.

My passion for creating, building and sharing, began during my childhood with Legos and has continued throughout my adult life in my involvement with the electricity, telecommunications, nutrition, and health industries. It is true that it takes lots of creativity to build something from scratch, whether it be a structure, a personal relationship, medicine or a new paradigm. But in order to achieve all this, we require a crucial element: information, data, a manual- something that catalogs the experiences and knowledge that we've accumulated and copied inside of our brains. Yes, I said copy- we are copying machines and we learn in this way; by copying and reorganizing information to give it relative meaning and context. I am very grateful for all the people who've left us information throughout history and who were able to transmit it verbally or textually by caring and sharing this information. And I am equally grateful for those who seek content with the sole intent to reinterpret this information in order to create something that can improve our lives. That is what Wikilife is all about, and I'm honored to contribute to such a project. As someone recently said to me, "If you know something, you have to share it.".

I am passionate about exploring health through data. I think Wikilife will help us better understand ourselves through more intelligent data collection and consumption. I joined the Wikilife team to to promote the adoption of our platform and expand the vision of how numbers can revolutionize how we think about health. I spearhead the Wikilife Infographic Project, a new initiative that invites student designers from around the world to visualize health as a part of college-level design curriculums. I also coordinate hackathons and work closely with Quantified Self leadership by co-organizing Quantified Self Boston, one of the largest QS groups. I live in Cambridge, MA and helped launch MIT's EyeWire, a game to map the brain. I founded and curate the TEDx Global Music Project, an initiative that collects, remasters and shares the best live music from TEDx events around the world.		</span>
