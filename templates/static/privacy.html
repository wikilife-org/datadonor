			<h2>Privacy and Sharing Statement</h2>

			<p><strong>By participating in the DataDonors website, you are participating in the The WikiLife Foundation’s mission. In addition to helping individuals gain insight into their health, a core purpose of The WikiLife Foundation, a Colorado nonprofit corporation (with its affiliates, “Wikilife,” “we” or “us”), is to share information with others so that as a society we can better understand the determinants of human health. When you send health and lifestyle data and other information to Wikilife, this information is then anonymized and made available to health researchers and other interested members of the public.  DataDonors is a Wikilife program that brings together companies and organizations for the purpose of gathering lifestyle data from Data Donors for the common good.  DataDonors is run, operated and administered by The WikiLife Foundation. To understand which information is shared and which is kept confidential, please review this Privacy and Sharing Statement carefully.</strong></p>

			<p>This Privacy and Sharing Statement is incorporated into and is subject to the WikiLife Terms of Service. Your use of the Wikilife Service and any information you provide on the Wikilife Service remains subject to our Terms of Service. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy and Sharing Statement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p>

			<h3>What is Personal Information? </h3>
			<p>Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, or other account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person, such as his or her health and lifestyle data or information about his or her use of the Wikilife Service. Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic location and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of users from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, your health and lifestyle data will be collected and combined with other users’ health and lifestyle data.  This aggregated and anonymized data is referred to as “Anonymized Data” (as described in the Terms of Service).</p>

			<h3>Your Profile</h3>
			<p>When you sign up with Wikilife, you may supply your birth date and various demographic information. Your profile information, but not your login ID, will be treated as “Lifestyle Data” (as described in the Terms of Service) and may be associated with your health and lifestyle data logs (posts) and returned as Anonymized Data in queries looking for patterns in the data gathered by Wikilife. Because your profile does not contain individually identifiable information such as your name, email address, or government-assigned numbers, researchers will not have access to that information unless you mention it in your posts.</p>
			<p>
			If Wikilife requires individually identifiable information in the future, that information will not be disclosed to other companies, researchers, or the public, except as needed for Wikilife to supply its services or communicate with you. Exceptions: Wikilife may disclose your information in response to legal process, or as otherwise required to comply with the law; to protect the rights or property of Wikilife or our users; Wikilife has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of any person; or to a successor in interest to the Wikilife web site(s), applications, or related assets.</p>

			<h3>Your Lifestyle Data</h3>
			<p>The health and lifestyle data logs (posts) you create using Wikilife will be treated as “Lifestyle Data” and are solely available to you, unless aggregated with other users’ Lifestyle Data and anonymized as “Anonymized Data.”  Wikilife may remove some sensitive information from a post if it recognizes the information as sensitive (such as a phone number written in a recognized format). However, to protect your privacy, you should not include highly sensitive information in your posts.</p>

			<p>The combination of demographic information and activity/relationship information might in some cases enable someone to identify a small group of people, or even an individual. Therefore, you may want to avoid providing highly specific activity/relationship information in your posts. For example, if you go to a coffee shop, you might prefer not to give the exact shop location and its distance from your home.</p>

			<h3>Accessing Third Party Data Providers</h3>
			<p>With the Wikilife Service, you may direct Wikilife to retrieve your information maintained online by Third Party Data Providers (as described in the Terms of Service). This information will be treated as Lifestyle Data. Wikilife uses oAuth authentication to connect to these Third Party Data Providers. Wikilife never sees your account password and never communicates any information to any third party servers except for communication with the Third Party Data Providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows users to approve an application to act on their behalf without sharing their password. More information can be found at oauth.net. You can at any time revoke permission to access data from the Third Party Data Providers in accordance with the instructions on the Wikilife website.</p>

			<h3>Public Information</h3>
			<p>The Wikilife Service also may offer social media opportunities for you to share your thoughts and experiences regarding your health and lifestyle in a public forum.  If at any time you share content on areas of the site that are generally accessible to other Website users, such content will be considered “Public User Content” (as described in the Terms of Service) and such content may be viewed by other users and by the general public, including any such content that contains personal information.</p>

			<h3>Deleting Content</h3>
			<p>You may modify or delete your User Generated Content (as described in the Terms of Service) in accordance with the instructions on the Wikilife website. Please be aware that even if Wikilife deletes such User Generated Content from its ‘live’ databases, such information may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes or previously downloaded by Researchers). We will not retrieve deleted content from our archives in order to publish it on the Wikilife Service or elsewhere, but please be aware that any Public User Content that you delete but that has been published or distributed in media other than the Wikilife Service prior to deletion may remain publicly available on areas other than the Wikilife Service in accordance with the User License Grant set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>

			<h3>Non-Identifying Technical Information</h3>
			<p>As you use Wikilife web site(s), we collect non-identifying information such as your search and browsing history (“usage information”). Your browser supplies various non-identifying information, including cookies and an IP address. Cookies may include third party cookies, such as analytics cookies (used to gather statistics about the use of the web site(s) and applications) and advertiser cookies (used to improve the relevance of advertisements displayed on the web site and in the applications), as well as Wikilife cookies. If you block cookies, the web site and applications may not function correctly. We may share non-identifying usage information with our vendors, suppliers, and others.</p>

			<p>When you use Wikilife applications on a mobile device, your device supplies a unique identifier, which we use to associate your Wikilife profile with your device. We also may associate location information provided by your device with posts made on the device. If your browser supplies location information (determined by your browser settings), we may associate that information with posts made using our web site(s).</p>

			<p>Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent. Any person who provides their personal information to Wikilife through our web site(s) or applications represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>

			<p>The Wikilife web site(s), applications, and related services are operated from the United States of America. By using our web site(s) or applications, you consent to the application of U.S. law to your information and to this Privacy and Sharing Statement.</p>

			<p>We may share some or all of your personal information with any current or future “affiliate” (which means a parent company, a subsidiary, joint venture, or other company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Wikilife), in which case we will require the affiliate to honor this privacy policy. If another company acquires Wikilife (or a business unit of Wikilife that uses your personal information), the personal information collected by Wikilife will be transferred to that company and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy and Sharing Statement.</p>

			<p>The Wikilife Foundation may revise this statement at any time, and the changed statement will be made available on our web site(s) with an updated effective date. By using our web site(s) or applications, you signify your acceptance of the revised statement. We encourage you to periodically review this statement so you know how we are protecting your information.</p>

			<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy and Sharing Statement, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@wikilife.org">info@wikilife.org</a></p>

			<p>Effective Date: 10-01-2013</p>
