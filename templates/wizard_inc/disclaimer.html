Description of Wikilife Service
Wikilife is a non-profit global collaborative experiment to collect health and lifestyle information and share it in an open and anonymous way.  

The Wikilife Service collects health and lifestyle data from its Data Donors.  A Data Donor can add data on the DataDonors Website regarding their lifestyle, work, exercise, sleep, eating patterns, mood and health, either by manually entering the data or by uploading their data from a device or connecting their account to a third party service. The Wikilife Service relates all of that Data Donor&#039;s information and the information of its other Data Donor&#039;s in a meaningful way.  Data Donors can compare their lifestyle data with that of other Data Donors around the world on the DataDonors Website.  Through the Wikilife Website, Researchers can access an extensive and comprehensive database of real-time health and lifestyle information available anywhere in the world.   The data collected will reveal patterns that will allow Data Donors and Researchers all over the world to elaborate hypotheses and develop unexplored research areas.

Because Wikilife is an open project, we make all aggregated and anonymized data accessible to anyone at any time. Your data is anonymous to everyone (except yourself) and is available for download in multiple formats.  For more information regarding how we share such aggregated and anonymized data (the  &#147;Anonymized Data&#148;), please refer to our Wikilife Privacy and Sharing Statement found on http://datadonors.org/privacy , the terms of which are incorporated into this Agreement (the  &#147;Privacy Statement&#148;).
